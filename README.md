### Issues
10/7 <br>
Okay I fixed the responsiveness for the phones I had viewed it in. 
I need to put my updated resume on here.
Then I need to update the stuff in the 'Selected Projects' for bigger screens
I also need to put the navbar up on top and whenever I scroll past that Landing page to stick and go solid color 
Add dark theme button on the nav bar. Also change the thing whenever I click the copy email

> - Mobile devices i.e. iPhone 12, the selected projects box is out of the page border
> - Fix view resume button. Add my resume to be viewable
> - The footer in mobile devices is crammed.
> - Add Dark Theme
