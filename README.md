### Issues
12/19 pt2 <br>
I finished the last things. I just need to finish the projects how the styling looks like in dark. 

12/19<br>
I have updated the most of my portfolio from making it light/dark mode
have done some adjustments to the about me. Need to fix how the navbar looks like 
on devices from the iPhone SE the sheet trigger is off-screen. 

10/8<br>
Okay i'm heated I can't figure out what is making the sheet trigger move on the x-axis whenever its in mobile view.
I just need to the spacing for the divs and the fix that issue and then mess around with color and see what goes good. 
Then i'm practically done maybe make it a bit prettier for  theh landing apge. goodnight fuck that sheet trigger.

Okay I fixed the responsiveness for the phones I had viewed it in. 
I need to put my updated resume on here.
Then I need to update the stuff in the 'Selected Projects' for bigger screens
I also need to put the navbar up on top and whenever I scroll past that Landing page to stick and go solid color 
Add dark theme button on the nav bar. Also change the thing whenever I click the copy email
